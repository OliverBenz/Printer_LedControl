# Printer_LedControl
The [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) 3D Printer management tool provides an API, which allows access to data like
"ExpectedTimeRemaining" or "Printer Status". <br />
This API is used to control an LED Strip (mounted on our 3D Printer) to display different colours depending on the printer status.  <br />

This repository also includes a simple effect script.

## Requirements
If the API functionality wants to be used, then [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) has to be configured first. <br />
The tutorial and curcuit to control the LED strip with a raspberry pi can be found [here](https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/).
